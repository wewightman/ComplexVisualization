This repository contains my work in visualizing (mostly) mathematics and other cool sciencey things.
I decided to start this hobby project in an attempt to retain what I have learned thoughout my educational career.
Inspired by Grant Sanderson, a phenomenal YouTube educator, I want to show people the beauty as well as the practicality of that which is hidden behind layers of unnecissary abstraction. Also. It looks *pretty*.

This work is all done with the Processing Library and is written in Java.

**_Visualizing Fourier Transforms_** *- 2019/12-present*

I began this project to refresh and build confidence with Fourier transforms and signal processing. The following components where built to gain familiarity with the platform. Each component can easily be applied to countless other projects

**Grapher** *- 2019/12-present*

A graphing package I wrote to get used to Processing. At its core, it maps a desired coordinate system onto the processing coordinate system. This class is the basis of my other pojects

**Complex** *- 2019/12-present*

A class representing classic, 2D complex numbers. Contains mathematical operations common to complex numbers.

**Fourier** *- 2019/12-present*

A class that computes a discrete Fourier on a series of datpoints represented with complex numbers.
